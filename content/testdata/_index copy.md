To move along a storied river like the Mississippi is to navigate a path cut for commodities with pumps, locks, and straightened bends.  U.S. ACE rarely meets a locale that it cannot clear or reengineer; much of the environment in the United States has been shaped in its image.  This is certainly the case at the lock where the reversed Chicago slurps from Lake Michigan, at the pumping stations that push effluent south, and at ship elevators along the Mississippi and its tributaries.  Able to shuttle massive barges across the country, ACE’s greatest challenge comes from small creatures.
