19th century engineering quickly proved insufficient for the burgeoning metropolis.  As commodities and labor swelled, so did byproducts and waste which spilled  into Lake Michigan, the cityâ€™s source drinking water.  Outbreaks of water-borne diseases like cholera required a public health response.  This did not prompt changes in industrial scale or practices, but rather more audacious engineering.

The dawn of the twentieth century brought the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal into being: the city was lifted to accommodate an underground sewer system then the river was reversed to flush byproducts and waste.  This marks the beginning of the backward river.  Until this point, a lazy river meandered toward Lake Michigan. Thereafter, a canal created a transcontinental toilet from Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico.

Since 1900 the engineered river originates from Lake Michigan, runs straight like a road through a corridor of sleek city skyscrapers then diverges into a North and a South Branch. The South Branch becomes increasingly industrial until it becomes the Sanitary and Ship Canal, easy to smell but difficult to view.
