      They really ask like an impossible task of you, and they try to brainwash you to think it's possible by having try-hard people promote all the items that they can stow in a day, which aren't really real, but yeah, it's just all around like a really stressful environment. And they don't give you enough time to recover and recoup between three hour shifts, they give you 30 minutes. And as Darra mentioned, it takes ten minutes to walk anywhere in Amazon from anywhere you are at, no matter where you are, it takes ten minutes to walk to where you need to be. So it's just hard to try and hustle when your legs are sore from standing for 6 hours straight. And then you're also tired because your arms and shoulders hurt from stowing things that are way above your head. 


      I have family members who- I don't know anybody that works at Amazon, honestly, beyond me and you, but I have family members who've made entire lives off working warehouses, warehouse, blue collar work, basically. Well, my one cousin was very vocal from the jump. She's worked at Ford since 2012. And she was like, that job hurts. My fingers hurt. My body hurts. Like, the job is hard. And I was just like, I just feel like maybe you're overdoing it. Literally. How old was I in 2012? My 14 year old brain, I was like, yeah, she doesn’t know what it’s like. So I haven't thought again about warehouse jobs until I walked into Amazon for my first day. And I was like, oh, okay, this is awful. This is what everybody's talking about. This is why people are so anti-Amazon. Because I didn’t understand why people were anti-Amazon exactly. I'm like, it's a corporation, so there's blood and there's death all around it. So I'm like, I don't know why this one is so specifically being attacked, but I think now it's because of how, since the corporation is - the needs are so high for that specific corporation, like anyone, but specifically Amazon, they whip you more, so you get more lashings if, you know, so it's more aggressive in that way, for sure. So I wasn't expecting it to be an impossible job. I was expecting there to be a way for you to get through the day with all you could do, like preparing in the morning and stretching all this. That the work could be doable, and it's not. Not in any reasonable sense of getting work done in a day’s span. No, you can't do it, but you have to try. So you do.


      Long story short, the question was, what do people not understand about working at Amazon? It's just really like you don't understand how little they care about their employees. I think you can talk about it all day long, but actually being an employee there and realizing they don't care that I get the correct pay, they don't care that I get all my time off, they don't care about any of that. They care that I send out 1200 items in a day. That's all they care about. It's sad. It's sad and it's really frustrating at the same time. And those are like really bad emotions to have towards the job that you're trying to do. And especially when you have all these requirements you want to meet, when you don't want to meet them because you don't like your employer. That's what I think.

    intro: "### Two Amazon workers speaking in spring 2022 about why they work at
      Amazon despite how physically demanding and depressing it is."

      Okay, so basically it makes me feel like you never finish anything because once you finish all of your work, they just bring you new work. So it's not like, oh, okay, so like, today, okay, once I finish this, then I'll be done with work for the day, and then I can move on to something else, like a normal job. When you have different kinds of projects, it's just like constant - they're bringing in boxes, they're bringing in boxes, they're bringing in boxes. There's never, like, a sense of accomplishment, I feel like. And that also makes it really hard to stay motivated because it's like, oh, once I finish these 97 items, they're in this big ass box. I'll be cool. No, they're going to bring you 97 more items each time. Like, there's nothing you can do to finish your work until you leave and clock out. That's fucking depressing. 


      Okay, so I make $20 an hour on Amazon. And that's like well, it's like about $4 more than I'd make as a gallery assistant, like, in the real world, which is like a job in the career path of what I actually studied to do with my life. So it's like when you compare the monetary, literally just the monetary, because Amazon is Amazon, you get your check, you can apply for benefits and stuff, but you have to commit so much more of your soul to get those things. And I'm like, girl, please. But if I were to work at a gallery and they would give me benefits and time off, and then they'd be like, less physically demanding work, and more satisfying for my soul to be there. So, like, the $4 cut wouldn't be that bad there bad or like, you think it would be that bad. It's like they do it like that so that you are forced to really be like, damn, it's still like $20. I'm still young, and $20 is a lot. Like, I'm not used. But it's like when you get there, you stand there for an hour and you're like, was that really worth $20? I immediately want to go home, and I don't care about the money anymore. I'll quit. When you got a car note and the rent and utilities to pay, it's a good wage. You have to do it. Yes. 


      That's kind of where I'm at right now. I am starting off. I'm fresh out of college, so I don't have any, like, saved money or assets. I have to start everything from scratch. So as I'm trying to build and save with that, I have to work some weekends at Amazon in addition to my full time job. I wouldn't work at Amazon if I didn't have to. I don't like working there, and I just want to stay and work a couple of days a month. It's not like that. It's literally I have to in order to live the lifestyle that I want to live. So it's okay for that. But if I had to work at Amazon four days as my full time career or anything like that, I don't think $16.50 would be sufficient. 


      Exactly. Yeah. And I feel like that's really what this question is about. It’s not for people, like, you and me, we just work there because what else is there? We're not trying to support kids and pay mortgages and shit. So it's really great for us in that regard because having actually actualized Amazon as a career for myself, it would be really tough. It's like, this is it for the next 30 years, is what I'm going to do. Like, watch my body fade away for fucking $20 an hour and nothing else. Like, as a full grown adult, all you have is, all you get is money. That's not enough. There's no satisfaction, like, psychologically, there's no benefits, there's no dental, there's no, like, everything you want to come out, like, you got to pay for it all. There’s no seeing your work do anything in the end. Yeah. You don't see somebody getting their package of socks and joy on their face when it happens or anything. There's no fulfillment after you stow that item. There's no fulfillment at the fulfillment center. Hashtag.

    intro: "### Yana Kalmyka, formerly with [Warehouse Workers for Justice
      (WWJ)](https://www.ww4j.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about how farmers,
      conservationists and warehouse workers have aligned to fight against a
      major warehouse development in Joliet, breaking down the environment vs
      jobs dichotomy with which we are often presented."

      Will County, where I work mainly, is such a company town, essentially, of warehousing. And we see a lot of the local electeds taking warehouse money from these big companies. And then it becoming really hard to stand in the way of new warehouse developments. We really came to this work because there was a proposed development of warehousing that would expand, I believe to six times the size of Midway Airport. And that is on top of a place that's already so inundated with warehousing, right? And a bunch of local farmers actually became really concerned about what this meant for farmland. And there is a prairie preserve in the area, too. So conservationists got concerned, were organizing against this new development and then kept running into this question of, well, how are you going to stand against this development if it's bringing jobs to the community, if it's bringing economic development, right? And eventually, after hearing that enough times, they found Warehouse Workers for Justice and said, well, what about the jobs? Right? What are the warehouse workers thinking about all of this? And we went to the warehouse workers and the real answer was, these jobs are not worth it. If we're talking about lifelong health and environmental degradation, it's not necessarily worth it. And also, if we're thinking about what kind of jobs they are, not that anything necessarily would be worth planetary destruction, but to say that pitching the jobs as benefits when folks are really risking their lives, losing their lives even before the pandemic, but especially exacerbated by the pandemic - it's wrong. And so warehouse workers really started working together with farmers to organize against this big development called North Point. And that's kind of how we came to the environmental work. And we really started interrogating what are the intersections of the labor and environmental issues

    intro: "### Yana Kalmyka, formerly with [Warehouse Workers for Justice
      (WWJ)](https://www.ww4j.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about the
      sacrifices that warehouse workers made during the Covid-19 pandemic, which
      enabled much of society to stay safely at home."

      **Transcript of recording**


      A large percentage of warehouse workers are temporary workers. And so we know that across Illinois, 85% of temp workers are primarily Black and Latino. And we also did a survey in December of 2020 where we talked to our networks of workers to see who was represented and what their experiences were like in the workplace. And we found that of our folks, less than 10% of the workers in our network self-identified as white. And so it is a predominantly people of color and low wage industry, partially because of the temp component of all of this. But I also want to name, in terms of who are warehouse workers, just that warehouse workers are the reason that a lot of us were able to stay home and really be safe during the pandemic. The reason that we could get stuff delivered to the comfort of our homes, to our very front doors, was because warehouse workers never stopped going to work. And folks who had the luxury, like us right now, to sit on Zoom and have virtual meetings were able to then get stuff delivered to their homes that they needed and were allowed to stay safe because of the work of warehouse workers. And some other stats that I wanted to pull out from our report, which came out in January of 2021, it's called [The Covid Jungle](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ww4j.org/uploads/7/0/0/6/70064813/wwj_food_workers_report-2-1.pdf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1681671024074074&usg=AOvVaw2BfQEeJEZPGZMxn8ejaIEq), and it really focused on working conditions throughout the pandemic. But I wanted to pull out that almost all of our interviewed workers made less than $20 an hour, and 56% of them made less than $15 an hour. And at the same time, 83% of them had a caretaking responsibility. So either an elderly parent, a disabled family member, or a child. And 96% of them, at the time of interview, were not receiving any hazard pay, which is heightened pay for going to work in more dangerous working conditions. 83% of the workers that we talked to who got Covid during the pandemic did not receive any paid sick leave. And this is really important because folks, if they're not receiving paid sick leave and if they are making low wages and can't afford to skip a paycheck, right, a lot of the time folks might go to work because they feel like they have to, not report symptoms and not take care of their bodies, but then also get other coworkers sick as a result of that. And then 50% of the workers we talked to didn't have any health insurance, and 20% qualified for Medicaid, so 70% of them were not getting health insurance through their job at all. And so I just share all that to say that acknowledging how essential warehouse workers were during the Pandemic, they were also some of the most oppressed folks in the workforce at that time and were not adequately repaid for the sacrifices that they made going to work.
