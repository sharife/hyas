Introduction
Why do we call a river, a waterbody known for turns and bends, a pipeline?

Everything that courses through a pipeline is introduced. Such things enter a pipeline through a set of decisions made by the pipeline operator.  When a corporation wants to move oil toward a market, they push it through a pipeline.  When a factory wants to get rid of chemical byproducts, they pipe it outside the plant.  After we have used water, we send it down the drain. When Chicago could no longer confront its waste, it built the canal. Pipes reflect intention in their very direction. 
Body
We think of rivers coursing in a natural path, whereas pipelines direct flows according to human will. The Chicago River was harnessed, straightened into a canal and pressed into the service of conveying coal, oil and petroleum coke, and other products.  It was even reversed in order to carry unwanted water away from the city through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.  Although it is not covered like a pipe, the river functions like a pipeline.  Oil and gas pipelines become known for their breaches and their damages.  The river can also overflow with sewage. 
In this way, the river resembles the main trunk of a pipeline system with smaller inflow pipes.  These smaller pipes drain effluent into the Chicago River during a rainstorm.

The Chicago River does not act alone.  When we consider how canals fit the definition of pipelines, Illinois waterways can appear as a vast pipeline network. Each river is conjoined one to another in an engineered connection between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico.  This liquid pipeline network carries the waste of metropolitan Chicago southward as it cuts the path for barges to transfer petrochemical products and other commodities among regions.

The canal may flow with freshwater drawn from Lake Michigan, but it looks quite different from a river. The Army Corps of Engineers directs  currents through a series of locks.  It is a controlled waterway, murky but smooth, as close as water can come to being paved.  It’s no coincidence that the canal is often referred to as a “highway.” But the term highway can be misleading. Interstates are available to the public; as they ribbon and cut through the landscape of the U.S., our vehicles access highways easily. The canal and those linked to it, on the other hand, are  withdrawn from public view. Like most pipelines, it functions in a geographic shroud, ensconced by private development.

When people observe the canal, it is bound up in two conflicting narratives. In one, it is an engineering marvel, praised for its use in reversing the Chicago River. In the other, the canal is the pathway for unwelcome species, known as “bio-invaders,” who threaten the Great Lakes. 

When we view this waterway as a pipeline, we can see how the forged connection between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico allows for circulation.  It was engineered at the beginning of the 20th Century to send northern industrial waste southward and to allow commodities to flow.  As the commodities flowed in multiple directions, their movement benefited a small cadre of industrialists.  This continues to be the case.  

When commodities and waste are moved across the globe, life moves with them.  In this way, species have been introduced into North American rivers and the Great Lakes.  They circulate with the products and the people drawn to sites of opportunity.
