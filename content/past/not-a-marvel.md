    intro: "### **Edith Tovar, Senior Justice Transition Organizer with [Little
      Village Environmental Justice Organization
      (LVEJO)](http://www.lvejo.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about the
      intersection of environmental justice, labor and public health in Little
      Village and its industrial corridor.**"
    body: Within the industrial corridors, like we realized, because of how big they
      are, because of the importance that they have carried where we don't
      minimize the importance of having local jobs, the importance of having a
      closed economy within our community. A lot of these jobs were beneficial
      to a lot of working class families in establishing roots and being able to
      purchase their homes, being able to raise their families, right? But
      within the passing decades, what do we know? We know that our community
      has one of the largest asthma rates. We know that when the Crawford coal
      plant was operating within the industrial corridor, we know that every
      year we lost about 50 residents to premature deaths. We know that cardiac
      disease is rampant in our communities. Why? Because close to 50% of our
      land use is dedicated to industry. So these are like the type of
      connections that LVEJO really tries to make- where industry and corporate
      polluters do such a great job at green washing and selling the idea of
      jobs and the creation of thousands of jobs in the industrial corridor.
      Again, we love jobs. We want our community to be able to have access to
      thriving, living wages, right? We don't want extractive working conditions
      for a community that is already struggling with like all the other -isms,
      right? And so trying to make that connection within environmental justice
      and labor and public health is one of these three layers. I think now
      we're working with it and our community is picking up on the language and
      saying - challenging a lot of these narratives that corporations are
      trying to sell to us, right? That because we're going to install solar
      panels, like everything is going to be great. Don't mind the 400 plus
      trucks that we're going to be coming in and out of this warehouse, right,
      on a daily basis. At least now folks are questioning like, whoa, why are
      there so many trucks to begin with? And are these jobs, are these union
      jobs or what's the starting minimum wage? Are these salary jobs? What kind
      of benefits are you going to include? Tuition waivers? And so these are
      the questions that we are supporting residents and asking and teaching
      them how to negotiate, or how not to negotiate, but teaching them about
      knowing their own work rights. And again, we want industry, we believe
      that industry can be great. But the type of industry that is not
      extractive. The type of industry that will not literally put our health at
      risk just so that we can have a decent job, we want to make sure that
      these jobs are like - benefiting our communities. We just don't want a
      company that shows up and just ignores everything that's happening outside
      of their industry walls, right? We want active participants of our
      community.

Nineteenth century engineering quickly proved insufficient for the burgeoning metropolis. As commodities and labor swelled, so did byproducts and waste which spilled into Lake Michigan, the city’s source of drinking water. Outbreaks of water-borne diseases like cholera required a public health response. They did not prompt changes in industrial scale or practices, but rather more audacious engineering.



The city was lifted to accommodate an underground sewer system then the river was reversed to flush byproducts and waste. This marks the beginning of the backward river. Until this point, a lazy river meandered toward Lake Michigan. Thereafter, a canal created a transcontinental toilet from Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. 



Since 1900 the engineered river originates from Lake Michigan, runs straight like a pipe through a corridor of sleek city skyscrapers then diverges into a North and a South Branch. The South Branch becomes increasingly industrial until it becomes the Sanitary and Ship Canal, easy to smell but difficult to view.



Factories tend to be built alongside water to facilitate the release of industrial byproducts. A waterway that people prefer not to notice proved a boon for coal-fired power plants and industry in general. A series of foul channels cut into neighborhoods on Chicago’s west side and pool the toxins from industrial corridors.



The Sanitary and Ship Canal functions within the larger Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) that drains some of North America’s most poisonous shores, the steel mill country of southeast Chicago and northwest Indiana. Many of the big mills have long closed, leaving their hulking structures to suggest a fallen civilization and their chemical remains to metastasize in the present. Facing shuttered mills and abandoned workers, local governments zoned the waterways as industrial corridors with lax standards for safety and sustainability. As such, the Calumet River has long served as the Calumet-Saganashkee (Cal-Sag) Channel that supplies industry with its base materials and loads its commodities.



The transformation of rivers into a waterway system is confirmed by the powerlines, byproduct piles and spaceship-shaped gas receptacles that line its path. From the roads that follow the canals, one sees industry rather than water.



#### Immigration Waves and Labor Power 



The historic occasion of building the Sanitary and Ship Canal to reverse the river catalyzed Chicago's growth into one of the nation’s largest cities and a center of [international trade and commerce](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/history.html). With industrial waste pumped far away on the public’s dime, factories multiplied exponentially. Heavy manufacturing [and stockyards lined the banks of the canal](https://interactive.wttw.com/chicago-river-tour/history-chicago-river) and the South Branch, transforming them into oozing waste pools. Stockyard engineers tore through wetlands around the South Branch and replaced them with a massive system that drained wastes from 325 acres of meatpacking factories into the now hard-edged river. In the famous muckraking book The Jungle, author Upton Sinclair named a fork of the river Bubbly Creek. He describes "(b)ubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding." 



Mass production that created this riverscape attracted i[mmigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html) seeking possibilities from across the world. Eventually, neighborhoods along the South Branch and the Sanitary and Ship Canal became an entry point for [working-class immigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/765.html) [of different](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html) backgrounds, who flocked in and out of communities such as Pilsen, Back of the Yards, Lawndale and Little Village.  Although industrial expansion enabled settlement and economic growth, it was often unregulated, forcing immigrants to confront hazardous working conditions, low wages, long hours and polluted environments. In response, residents of these neighborhoods joined together [in a vibrant Chicago labor](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Pilsen_Historic_District_Prelim_Summ.pdf) movement, engaging in protests and strikes, even when met with [violence](https://news.wttw.com/2022/03/05/little-village-mural-depicts-chicago-s-labor-legacy). 



Today, these neighborhoods are home to a majority working-class, Latine immigrant population, and strong grassroot organizations addressing environmental and [labor injustices](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2021/9/23/22690939/el-milagro-employees-fair-wages-end-harsh-working-conditions-walkout-little-village). For example, Pilsen annually hosts the well-known [Fiesta de Sol](https://fiestadelsol.org/about/), a Latine cultural festival that celebrates social transformation through community connection and highlights local organizations, businesses and projects. Little Village, commonly known as La Villita, welcomes people with a gateway that reads “[Bienvenidos a Little Village](https://www.chicagotribune.com/voice-it/ct-the-landmark-that-welcomes-mexicans-in-the-midwest-20180918-story.html).” A two-mile stretch on La Villita’s 26th street gained its own nickname as the “second Magnificent Mile,” lined with local panaderias, eloteros, and tamaleros, colorful restaurants and murals, and the [Discount Mall that resembles un tianguis, a Mexican market.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-little-village-discount-mall-reduction-renovation-novak-vendors-profiles-20230302-lfkmgsmvsbeyfelv2bnxbjt6j4-story.html) 



Over time, industry shifted from meatpacking to coal-fired power plants and heavy manufacturing, to the warehouses and logistics of today. With its need for labor power, industry is often attracted to neighborhoods with a high number of immigrants, and many new immigrants seek to live where employment is readily available. Despite the changing nature of industry, exploitation of the immigrant workforce persists. This continued pattern is repeatedly met with the strength and imagination of an ongoing Chicago labor movement.
