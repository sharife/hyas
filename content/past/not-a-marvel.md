      Within the industrial corridors, like we realized, because of how
      big they are, because of the importance that they have carried where we
      don't minimize the importance of having local jobs, the importance of
      having a closed economy within our community. A lot of these jobs were
      beneficial to a lot of working class families in establishing roots and
      being able to purchase their homes, being able to raise their families,
      right? But within the passing decades, what do we know? We know that our
      community has one of the largest asthma rates. We know that when the
      Crawford coal plant was operating within the industrial corridor, we know
      that every year we lost about 50 residents to premature deaths. We know
      that cardiac disease is rampant in our communities. Why? Because close to
      50% of our land use is dedicated to industry. So these are like the type
      of connections that LVEJO really tries to make- where industry and
      corporate polluters do such a great job at green washing and selling the
      idea of jobs and the creation of thousands of jobs in the industrial
      corridor. Again, we love jobs. We want our community to be able to have
      access to thriving, living wages, right? We don't want extractive working
      conditions for a community that is already struggling with like all the
      other -isms, right? And so trying to make that connection within
      environmental justice and labor and public health is one of these three
      layers. I think now we're working with it and our community is picking up
      on the language and saying - challenging a lot of these narratives that
      corporations are trying to sell to us, right? That because we're going to
      install solar panels, like everything is going to be great. Don't mind the
      400 plus trucks that we're going to be coming in and out of this
      warehouse, right, on a daily basis. At least now folks are questioning
      like, whoa, why are there so many trucks to begin with? And are these
      jobs, are these union jobs or what's the starting minimum wage? Are these
      salary jobs? What kind of benefits are you going to include? Tuition
      waivers? And so these are the questions that we are supporting residents
      and asking and teaching them how to negotiate, or how not to negotiate,
      but teaching them about knowing their own work rights. And again, we want
      industry, we believe that industry can be great. But the type of industry
      that is not extractive. The type of industry that will not literally put
      our health at risk just so that we can have a decent job, we want to make
      sure that these jobs are like - benefiting our communities. We just don't
      want a company that shows up and just ignores everything that's happening
      outside of their industry walls, right? We want active participants of our
      community.

      Will county, where I work mainly, is such a company town,
      essentially, of warehousing. And we see a lot of the local electeds taking
      warehouse money from these big companies. And then it becoming really hard
      to stand in the way of new warehouse developments. We really came to this
      work because there was a proposed development of warehousing that would
      expand, I believe to six times the size of Midway Airport. And that is on
      top of a place that's already so inundated with warehousing, right? And a
      bunch of local farmers actually became really concerned about what this
      meant for farmland. And there is a prairie preserve in the area, too. So
      conservationists got concerned, were organizing against this new
      development and then kept running into this question of, well, how are you
      going to stand against this development if it's bringing jobs to the
      community, if it's bringing economic development, right? And eventually,
      after hearing that enough times, they found warehouse workers for justice
      and said, well, what about the jobs? Right? What are the warehouse workers
      think about all of this? And we went to the warehouse workers and the real
      answer was, these jobs are not worth it. If we're talking about lifelong
      health and environmental degradation, it's not necessarily worth it. And
      also, if we're thinking about what kind of jobs they are, not that
      anything necessarily would be worth planetary destruction, but to say that
      pitching the jobs as benefits when folks are really risking their lives,
      losing their lives even before the pandemic, but especially exacerbated by
      the pandemic - it's wrong. And so warehouse workers really started working
      together with farmers to organize against this big development called
      North Point. And that's kind of how we came to the environmental work. And
      we really started interrogating what are the intersections of the labor
      and environmental issues

    intro: "### Yana Kalmyka, formerly with [Warehouse Workers for Justice
      (WWJ)](https://www.ww4j.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about the
      sacrifices that warehouse workers made during the Covid-19 pandemic, which
      enabled much of society to stay safely at home."

      A large percentage of warehouse workers are temporary workers.
      And so we know that across Illinois, 85% of temp workers are primarily
      Black and Latino. And we also did a survey in December of 2020 where we
      talked to our networks of workers to see who was represented and what
      their experiences were like in the workplace. And we found that of our
      folks, less than 10% of the workers in our network self-identified as
      white. And so it is a predominantly people of color and low wage industry,
      partially because of the temp component of all of this. But I also want to
      name, in terms of who are warehouse workers, just that warehouse workers
      are the reason that a lot of us were able to stay home and really be safe
      during the pandemic. The reason that we could get stuff delivered to the
      comfort of our homes, to our very front doors, was because warehouse
      workers never stopped going to work. And folks who had the luxury, like us
      right now, to sit on Zoom and have virtual meetings were able to then get
      stuff delivered to their homes that they needed and were allowed to stay
      safe because of the work of warehouse workers. And some other stats that I
      wanted to pull out from our report, which came out in January of 2021,
      it's called The Covid Jungle, and it really focused on working conditions
      throughout the pandemic. But I wanted to pull out that almost all of our
      interviewed workers made less than $20 an hour, and 56% of them made less
      than $15 an hour. And at the same time, 83% of them had a caretaking
      responsibility. So either an elderly parent, a disabled family member, or
      a child. And 96% of them, at the time of interview, were not receiving any
      hazard pay, which is heightened pay for going to work in more dangerous
      working conditions. 83% of the workers that we talked to who got Covid
      during the pandemic did not receive any paid sick leave. And this is
      really important because folks, if they're not receiving paid sick leave
      and if they are making low wages and can't afford to skip a paycheck,
      right, a lot of the time folks might go to work because they feel like
      they have to, not report symptoms and not take care of their bodies, but
      then also get other coworkers sick as a result of that. And then 50% of
      the workers we talked to didn't have any health insurance, and 20%
      qualified for Medicaid, so 70% of them were not getting health insurance
      through their job at all. And so I just share all that to say that
      acknowledging how essential warehouse workers were during the Pandemic,
      they were also some of the most oppressed folks in the workforce at that
      time and were not adequately repaid for the sacrifices that they made
      going to work.
  - audio: Amazon workers - Amazon doesn't care.mp3
    intro: "### Two Amazon workers speaking in spring 2022 about how workers at
      Amazon are set up for an impossible and incredibly strenuous job, and how
      little the corporation cares about its employees."
    body: >-
      **Transcript of recording**
      
      
      They really ask like an impossible task of you, and they try to brainwash
      you to think it's possible by having try-hard people promote all the items
      that they can stow in a day, which aren't really real, but yeah, it's just
      all around like a really stressful environment. And they don't give you
      enough time to recover and recoup between three hour shifts, they give you
      30 minutes. And as Darra mentioned, it takes ten minutes to walk anywhere
      in Amazon from anywhere you are at, no matter where you are, it takes ten
      minutes to walk to where you need to be. So it's just hard to try and
      hustle when your legs are sore from standing for 6 hours straight. And
      then you're also tired because your arms and shoulders hurt from stowing
      things that are way above your head. 




      I have family members who- I don't know anybody that works at Amazon, honestly, beyond me and you, but I have family members who've made entire lives off working warehouses, warehouse, blue collar work, basically. Well, my one cousin was very vocal from the jump. She's worked at Ford since 2012. And she was like, that job hurts. My fingers hurt. My body hurts. Like, the job is hard. And I was just like, I just feel like maybe you're overdoing it. Literally. How old was I in 2012? My 14 year old brain, I was like, yeah, she doesn’t know what it’s like. So I haven't thought again about warehouse jobs until I walked into Amazon for my first day. And I was like, oh, okay, this is awful. This is what everybody's talking about. This is why people are so anti-Amazon. Because I didn’t understand why people were anti-Amazon exactly. I'm like, it's a corporation, so there's blood and there's death all around it. So I'm like, I don't know why this one is so specifically being attacked, but I think now it's because of how, since the corporation is - the needs are so high for that specific corporation, like anyone, but specifically Amazon, they whip you more, so you get more lashings if, you know, so it's more aggressive in that way, for sure. So I wasn't expecting it to be an impossible job. I was expecting there to be a way for you to get through the day with all you could do, like preparing in the morning and stretching all this. That the work could be doable, and it's not. Not in any reasonable sense of getting work done in a day’s span. No, you can't do it, but you have to try. So you do.




      Long story short, the question was, what do people not understand about working at Amazon? It's just really like you don't understand how little they care about their employees. I think you can talk about it all day long, but actually being an employee there and realizing they don't care that I get the correct pay, they don't care that I get all my time off, they don't care about any of that. They care that I send out 1200 items in a day. That's all they care about. It's sad. It's sad and it's really frustrating at the same time. And those are like really bad emotions to have towards the job that you're trying to do. And especially when you have all these requirements you want to meet, when you don't want to meet them because you don't like your employer. That's what I think.

      Amazon despite how physically demanding and depressing it is."

      Okay, so basically it makes me feel like you never finish anything because
      once you finish all of your work, they just bring you new work. So it's
      not like, oh, okay, so like, today, okay, once I finish this, then I'll be
      done with work for the day, and then I can move on to something else, like
      a normal job. When you have different kinds of projects, it's just like
      constant - they're bringing in boxes, they're bringing in boxes, they're
      bringing in boxes. There's never, like, a sense of accomplishment, I feel
      like. And that also makes it really hard to stay motivated because it's
      like, oh, once I finish these 97 items, they're in this big ass box. I'll
      be cool. No, they're going to bring you 97 more items each time. Like,
      there's nothing you can do to finish your work until you leave and clock
      out. That's fucking depressing. 




      Okay, so I make $20 an hour on Amazon. And that's like well, it's like about $4 more than I'd make as a gallery assistant, like, in the real world, which is like a job in the career path of what I actually studied to do with my life. So it's like when you compare the monetary, literally just the monetary, because Amazon is Amazon, you get your check, you can apply for benefits and stuff, but you have to commit so much more of your soul to get those things. And I'm like, girl, please. But if I were to work at a gallery and they would give me benefits and time off, and then they'd be like, less physically demanding work, and more satisfying for my soul to be there. So, like, the $4 cut wouldn't be that bad there bad or like, you think it would be that bad. It's like they do it like that so that you are forced to really be like, damn, it's still like $20. I'm still young, and $20 is a lot. Like, I'm not used. But it's like when you get there, you stand there for an hour and you're like, was that really worth $20? I immediately want to go home, and I don't care about the money anymore. I'll quit. When you got a car note and the rent and utilities to pay, it's a good wage. You have to do it. Yes. 




      That's kind of where I'm at right now. I am starting off. I'm fresh out of college, so I don't have any, like, saved money or assets. I have to start everything from scratch. So as I'm trying to build and save with that, I have to work some weekends at Amazon in addition to my full time job. I wouldn't work at Amazon if I didn't have to. I don't like working there, and I just want to stay and work a couple of days a month. It's not like that. It's literally I have to in order to live the lifestyle that I want to live. So it's okay for that. But if I had to work at Amazon four days as my full time career or anything like that, I don't think $16.50 would be sufficient. 




      Exactly. Yeah. And I feel like that's really what this question is about. It’s not for people, like, you and me, we just work there because what else is there? We're not trying to support kids and pay mortgages and shit. So it's really great for us in that regard because having actually actualized Amazon as a career for myself, it would be really tough. It's like, this is it for the next 30 years, is what I'm going to do. Like, watch my body fade away for fucking $20 an hour and nothing else. Like, as a full grown adult, all you have is, all you get is money. That's not enough. There's no satisfaction, like, psychologically, there's no benefits, there's no dental, there's no, like, everything you want to come out, like, you got to pay for it all. There’s no seeing your work do anything in the end. Yeah. You don't see somebody getting their package of socks and joy on their face when it happens or anything. There's no fulfillment after you stow that item. There's no fulfillment at the fulfillment center. Hashtag.

Nineteenth century engineering quickly proved insufficient for the burgeoning metropolis. As commodities and labor swelled, so did byproducts and waste which spilled into Lake Michigan, the city’s source of drinking water. Outbreaks of water-borne diseases like cholera required a public health response. They did not prompt changes in industrial scale or practices, but rather more audacious engineering.



The city was lifted to accommodate an underground sewer system then the river was reversed to flush byproducts and waste. This marks the beginning of the backward river. Until this point, a lazy river meandered toward Lake Michigan. Thereafter, a canal created a transcontinental toilet from Chicago to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. 



Since 1900 the engineered river originates from Lake Michigan, runs straight like a pipe through a corridor of sleek city skyscrapers then diverges into a North and a South Branch. The South Branch becomes increasingly industrial until it becomes the Sanitary and Ship Canal, easy to smell but difficult to view.



Factories tend to be built alongside water to facilitate the release of industrial byproducts. A waterway that people prefer not to notice proved a boon for coal-fired power plants and industry in general. A series of foul channels cut into neighborhoods on Chicago’s west side and pool the toxins from industrial corridors.



The Sanitary and Ship Canal functions within the larger Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) that drains some of North America’s most poisonous shores, the steel mill country of southeast Chicago and northwest Indiana. Many of the big mills have long closed, leaving their hulking structures to suggest a fallen civilization and their chemical remains to metastasize in the present. Facing shuttered mills and abandoned workers, local governments zoned the waterways as industrial corridors with lax standards for safety and sustainability. As such, the Calumet River has long served as the Calumet-Saganashkee (Cal-Sag) Channel that supplies industry with its base materials and loads its commodities.



The transformation of rivers into a waterway system is confirmed by the powerlines, byproduct piles and spaceship-shaped gas receptacles that line its path. From the roads that follow the canals, one sees industry rather than water.



#### Immigration Waves and Labor Power 



The historic occasion of building the Sanitary and Ship Canal to reverse the river catalyzed Chicago's growth into one of the nation’s largest cities and a center of [international trade and commerce](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/history.html). With industrial waste pumped far away on the public’s dime, factories multiplied exponentially. Heavy manufacturing [and stockyards lined the banks of the canal](https://interactive.wttw.com/chicago-river-tour/history-chicago-river) and the South Branch, transforming them into oozing waste pools. Stockyard engineers tore through wetlands around the South Branch and replaced them with a massive system that drained wastes from 325 acres of meatpacking factories into the now hard-edged river. In the famous muckraking book The Jungle, author Upton Sinclair named a fork of the river Bubbly Creek. He describes "(b)ubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding." 



Mass production that created this riverscape attracted i[mmigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html) seeking possibilities from across the world. Eventually, neighborhoods along the South Branch and the Sanitary and Ship Canal became an entry point for [working-class immigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/765.html) [of different](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html) backgrounds, who flocked in and out of communities such as Pilsen, Back of the Yards, Lawndale and Little Village.  Although industrial expansion enabled settlement and economic growth, it was often unregulated, forcing immigrants to confront hazardous working conditions, low wages, long hours and polluted environments. In response, residents of these neighborhoods joined together [in a vibrant Chicago labor](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Pilsen_Historic_District_Prelim_Summ.pdf) movement, engaging in protests and strikes, even when met with [violence](https://news.wttw.com/2022/03/05/little-village-mural-depicts-chicago-s-labor-legacy). 



Today, these neighborhoods are home to a majority working-class, Latine immigrant population, and strong grassroot organizations addressing environmental and [labor injustices](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2021/9/23/22690939/el-milagro-employees-fair-wages-end-harsh-working-conditions-walkout-little-village). For example, Pilsen annually hosts the well-known [Fiesta de Sol](https://fiestadelsol.org/about/), a Latine cultural festival that celebrates social transformation through community connection and highlights local organizations, businesses and projects. Little Village, commonly known as La Villita, welcomes people with a gateway that reads “[Bienvenidos a Little Village](https://www.chicagotribune.com/voice-it/ct-the-landmark-that-welcomes-mexicans-in-the-midwest-20180918-story.html).” A two-mile stretch on La Villita’s 26th street gained its own nickname as the “second Magnificent Mile,” lined with local panaderias, eloteros, and tamaleros, colorful restaurants and murals, and the [Discount Mall that resembles un tianguis, a Mexican market.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-little-village-discount-mall-reduction-renovation-novak-vendors-profiles-20230302-lfkmgsmvsbeyfelv2bnxbjt6j4-story.html) 



Over time, industry shifted from meatpacking to coal-fired power plants and heavy manufacturing, to the warehouses and logistics of today. With its need for labor power, industry is often attracted to neighborhoods with a high number of immigrants, and many new immigrants seek to live where employment is readily available. Despite the changing nature of industry, exploitation of the immigrant workforce persists. This continued pattern is repeatedly met with the strength and imagination of an ongoing Chicago labor movement.
