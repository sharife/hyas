intro: The Chicago River was engineered at the beginning of the 20th Century to
  send northern industrial waste southward and to allow commodities to
  circulate. As the commodities flowed in multiple directions, their movement
  benefited a small cadre of capitalists. This continues to be the case.

Native travelers knew how to portage through the marshland that would become Chicago and shared this knowledge with early explorers and settlers. To colonial eyes, the swampy link between the river and the lake seemed the perfect place for a permanent cut. So, in 1848, the Chicago River was expanded as the Illinois-Michigan (I&M) Canal. 19th century engineering quickly proved insufficient for the burgeoning metropolis. The I&M Canal worked with the railroad system to draw resources and people into Chicago where they were transformed into commodities and labor.Â 

The pre-industrial span of the Chicago River included North and South Branches and a Main Stem. In the name of flushing the metropolis and allowing for the circulation of commodities, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was forged in 1900. Its perceived success led to the North Shore Channel that drains upscale suburbs and later to the artery for heavy industry, the Calumet-Saganashkee (Cal-Sag) Channel to the south.
