intro: "### The Chicago River was engineered at the beginning of the 20th
  Century to send northern industrial waste southward and to allow commodities
  to circulate.  It catalyzed Chicago's growth into one of the nation’s largest
  cities and a center of [international trade and
  commerce](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/about/history.html)."

      I'm really excited to have this conversation about the river because actually, the history of warehousing and goods movement in general has such a long history with the Chicago River in particular. In the mid 1800s, when the Illinois and Michigan Canal were built, they used the Chicago River to connect the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes for the first time, which really changed the way that goods movement and development happens in the city and probably in the world. And we saw instead of three weeks to get from one end to the other, it started taking a day, and that really changed everything. The entire locus of goods movement in the United States moved from St. Louis to Chicago when that happened. So by 1870, Chicago was the busiest port in the United States. There are more ships at the City's harbor than New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia combined. And in that process, the first modern distribution center, like a really big warehouse was created, which is pretty much exactly where the Freshwater Lab Festival took place, pretty much exactly where we were sitting at the [Backward River Festival](https://thebackwardriver.org/get-involved/backward-river-festival/). And also in the 1850s, the US was in the middle of this really rapid railroad expansion. And as soon as the canal opened, construction started on Chicago's first railway. And so today we see that there's over 25 intermodal railyards throughout Chicago, all located on the south and west sides. And Chicago remains this really vital foothold in the warehouse industry. 


      And this is really where Warehouse Workers for Justice was born. So Will County, or the Chicago land area kind of broadly, is the only place for six major railroads meet out of seven in the United States. It's also where a lot of major highways are intersecting. And the Chicago land area is a day's trip from about 60% of the continent. And so that makes Will County home to the nation's largest inland port, which is CenterPoint. And it's between Joliet and Elwood, where our office is and it's just really interesting because the river is such a huge part of this expansion and of the existence of the concept of warehousing as a whole. But I also bring up the fact that the largest inland port in North America is in the Chicago land area to talk about the fact that we have a lot of power in this region uniquely. And so Warehouse Workers for Justice was founded in 2007 because folks at a union, the United Electrical Workers, were interested in finding ways to creatively organize workers who have trouble for one reason or another, organizing themselves. And in case of warehousing, the prolific presence of third party logistics companies, temp agencies, etc makes it really hard to organize. And so union folks really came together and said, well, what industry needs organizing and also how do we do it creatively and also where do we have power, right? And after doing a power analysis, they really found out that the warehousing industry has to be where we're at right now and it can't move. And so this figure about this place being a day's trip from 60% of the continent becomes really important because you think about Amazon delivering next day, two-day, even same day I've been seeing that they deliver like the night of your order, which is absolutely nuts. But all that to say, we have such an incredible amount of power here because this is such a vital region to make that kind of quick delivery model possible. And so when we think about the potential of environmental organizing and labor organizing in this region, it seems like we can really have ripple effects throughout the country because if we can organize here, the companies can't move, right? And that's kind of the central concept of our organization.

Native travelers knew how to portage through the marshland that would become Chicago and shared this knowledge with early explorers and settlers. To colonial eyes, the swampy link between the river and the lake seemed the perfect place for a permanent cut. So, in 1848, the Chicago River was expanded as the Illinois-Michigan (I&M) Canal. 19th century engineering quickly proved insufficient for the burgeoning metropolis. The I&M Canal worked with the railroad system to draw resources and people into Chicago where they were transformed into commodities and labor. 

The historic occasion of building the Sanitary and Ship Canal enabled intense industrial development that attracted [immigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html)  from across the world seeking possibilities. With industrial waste pumped far away on the public’s dime, factories multiplied exponentially. Heavy manufacturing [and stockyards lined the banks of the canal](https://interactive.wttw.com/chicago-river-tour/history-chicago-river) and the South Branch, transforming them into oozing waste pools. Stockyard engineers tore through wetlands around the South Branch and replaced them with a massive system that drained wastes from 325 acres of meatpacking factories into the now hard-edged river. In the famous muckraking book The Jungle, author Upton Sinclair named a fork of the river Bubbly Creek. He describes how "(b)ubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding." 

Eventually, neighborhoods along the South Branch and the Sanitary and Ship Canal became an entry point for [working-class immigrants](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/765.html) [of different](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/2477.html) backgrounds, who flocked in and out of communities such as Pilsen, Back of the Yards, Lawndale and Little Village.  Although industrial expansion enabled settlement and economic growth, it was often unregulated, forcing immigrants to confront hazardous working conditions, low wages, long hours and polluted environments. In response, residents of these neighborhoods joined together in a vibrant Chicago labor movement, engaging in protests and strikes, even when met with [violence](https://news.wttw.com/2022/03/05/little-village-mural-depicts-chicago-s-labor-legacy). 

Today, these neighborhoods are home to a majority working-class, Latine immigrant population and strong grassroot organizations addressing environmental and [labor injustices](https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2021/9/23/22690939/el-milagro-employees-fair-wages-end-harsh-working-conditions-walkout-little-village). For example, Pilsen annually hosts the well-known [Fiesta de Sol](https://fiestadelsol.org/about/), a Latine cultural festival that celebrates social transformation through community connection and highlights local organizations, businesses and projects. Little Village, commonly known as La Villita, welcomes people with a gateway that reads “[Bienvenidos a Little Village](https://www.chicagotribune.com/voice-it/ct-the-landmark-that-welcomes-mexicans-in-the-midwest-20180918-story.html).” A two-mile stretch on La Villita’s 26th street gained its own nickname as the “second Magnificent Mile,” lined with local panaderias, eloteros, and tamaleros, colorful restaurants and murals, and the [Discount Mall that resembles un tianguis, a Mexican market.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-little-village-discount-mall-reduction-renovation-novak-vendors-profiles-20230302-lfkmgsmvsbeyfelv2bnxbjt6j4-story.html) 

Over time, industry shifted from meatpacking to coal-fired power plants and heavy manufacturing to the warehouses and logistics of today. With its need for labor power, industry is often attracted to neighborhoods with a high number of immigrants, and many new immigrants seek to live where employment is readily available. Despite the changing nature of industry, exploitation of the immigrant workforce persists. This continued pattern is repeatedly met with the strength and imagination of an ongoing Chicago labor movement.
