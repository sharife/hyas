### The marsh between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan was a fertile place that allowed for travel, trade, and connections among indigenous peoples.

Native travelers knew how to portage through the marsh and shared this knowledge with early explorers and settlers. To colonial eyes, the swampy link between the river and the lake seemed the perfect place for a permanent cut. So, in 1848, the river expanded as the Illinois-Michigan (I & M) Canal. The I & M Canal worked with the railroad system to draw resources and people into Chicago where they were transformed into commodities and labor. 

The pre-industrial span of the Chicago River included North and South Branches and a Main Stem. In the name of flushing the metropolis and allowing for the circulation of commodities, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was forged in 1900. Its perceived success led to the North Shore Channel that drains upscale suburbs and later to the artery for heavy industry, the Calumet-Saganashkee (Cal-Sag) Channel to the south.
