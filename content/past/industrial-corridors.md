intro: "### Industrial corridors (ICs) are often described [as specific areas
  designated for
  manufacturing](https://chicago.curbed.com/2017/9/19/16332590/transportation-c\
  hicago-river-history-future) that are located near transportation such as
  waterways, highways or rail lines. Boosters laud the industrial corridor
  system as essential to the regionâ€™s economy and advocate for protecting
  industrial land uses. But, for communities living in and around ICs, the
  zoning and pollution allowances compromise water, air and soil, which can lead
  to impaired public and mental health."

      Within the industrial corridors, like we realized, because of how big they are, because of the importance that they have carried where we don't minimize the importance of having local jobs, the importance of having a closed economy within our community. A lot of these jobs were beneficial to a lot of working class families in establishing roots and being able to purchase their homes, being able to raise their families, right? But within the passing decades, what do we know? We know that our community has one of the largest asthma rates. We know that when the Crawford coal plant was operating within the industrial corridor, we know that every year we lost about 50 residents to premature deaths. We know that cardiac disease is rampant in our communities. Why? Because close to 50% of our land use is dedicated to industry. So these are like the type of connections that LVEJO really tries to make- where industry and corporate polluters do such a great job at green washing and selling the idea of jobs and the creation of thousands of jobs in the industrial corridor. Again, we love jobs. We want our community to be able to have access to thriving, living wages, right? We don't want extractive working conditions for a community that is already struggling with like all the other -isms, right? And so trying to make that connection within environmental justice and labor and public health is one of these three layers. I think now we're working with it and our community is picking up on the language and saying - challenging a lot of these narratives that corporations are trying to sell to us, right? That is because we're going to install solar panels, like everything is going to be great. Don't mind the 400 plus trucks that we're going to be coming in and out of this warehouse, right, on a daily basis. At least now folks are questioning like, whoa, why are there so many trucks to begin with? And are these jobs, are these union jobs or what's the starting minimum wage? Are these salary jobs? What kind of benefits are you going to include? Tuition waivers? And so these are the questions that we are supporting residents and asking and teaching them how to negotiate, or how not to negotiate, but teaching them about knowing their own work rights. And again, we want industry, we believe that industry can be great. But the type of industry that is not extractive. The type of industry that will not literally put our health at risk just so that we can have a decent job, we want to make sure that these jobs are like - benefiting our communities. We just don't want a company that shows up and just ignores everything that's happening outside of their industry walls, right? We want active participants of our community.
