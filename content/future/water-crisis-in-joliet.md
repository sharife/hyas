title: Water Crisis in Joliet
x: "44"
y: "42"
intro: "### You would not expect to read about a water crisis alongside a river,
  but overextraction can cause depletion and watershed collapse anywhere. This
  has occurred in northeastern Illinois in the case of the impending collapse of
  the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer. At the same time, companies like Amazon have
  received tax breaks and water discounts to open warehouses in the area."

      Talking to you all at the Freshwater Lab, I want to share that Joliet is in the middle of a water crisis, and a lot of the south suburbs are close to follow. Joliet is projected to be unable to meet their demand with their current water source by 2030, so that's a timetable of less than ten years before people don't have access to that water. Currently, the water source is an aquifer, so it's more related to the lake than the river. But water systems are all deeply entwined. And it's really fascinating because people need a new water source. They're trying to build this billion dollar pipeline to Chicago to start getting water from Lake Michigan, which is great. And actually, a lot of our folks are excited to have potentially cleaner water than what they've had before. But the city is saying that to pay for this billion dollar pipeline, they are going to triple people's water bills. And we do a lot of engagement on the doors around this. And folks have told me straight up many times that they would have to leave their home, potentially a home that they grew up in or move their family to, or whatever many reasons folks might have for setting up a home in Joliet, but they wouldn't be able to afford their lifestyle anymore if their water bill tripled. Right. And for a working class person, and especially if we go back to my stats about how much warehouse workers in particular are making, that triple increase is really dire. 


      And so the other interesting part of all this is that Amazon alone has gotten about $741 million in tax breaks from Northeast Illinois alone. So just the Chicago land area that we're in. And that's almost enough to pay for the entire pipeline. And this is money that's coming from taxpayer dollars that has been given to Amazon to set up shop, to provide unsafe and unstable jobs for people. And so to say all that, some of the work we've been doing is getting community members together, really getting input on what we think might be a fair solution for the community, and landing on asking some of these huge multi billion dollar corporations that are profiting excessively from this region in particular, to pay a little bit more so that everyone else can pay a little less. And out of our curiosity, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request, which was subsequently covered in a [Belt article](https://beltmag.com/joliet-illinois-largest-inland-port-running-out-of-water/) by a great reporter, Adam Mahoney. And we were curious to know how much Amazon is using and other warehouses are using. And we found that Amazon by itself, so just one of hundreds of warehouses in Will County, is using over 106 times the water as a regular household, and yet are paying pretty much the same rate. Right. And not to mention all the tax breaks they're getting. So within those tax breaks or water bills, are more than covered, right?

      incredible cost of Joliet’s drinking water crisis while warehouses like
      Amazon have simultaneously received immense tax breaks and discounts on
      water to operate in the area.

The biggest drawdown of the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer from a single community has been in the city of Joliet (the third most populous city in Illinois), where the aquifer’s water level has fallen by over 800 feet. Joliet and other southwestern suburbs of Chicago in Will, Kendall, Kane and DuPage counties are at the highest risk of aquifer collapse. In this area, sustainable withdrawals from the aquifer would fall between 2 to 7 million gallons per day (mgd), yet in 2018 total demand on the aquifer was 36.7 mgd. 12.8 mgd of this demand came from three large petrochemical users.

In March 2021, Joliet entered an agreement with the City of Chicago to switch its water supply to Lake Michigan water, treated by the Chicago Department of Water Management. Chicago agreed to begin supplying Joliet with water no later than January 1, 2030 for a duration of 100 years.  Joliet will then supply the water to its customers within and beyond its municipal boundaries.

The historic agreement in which the City of Chicago pledged to supply Joliet with treated Lake Michigan water will not be sufficient to alleviate risk to the regional groundwater supply. The Illinois State Water Survey (ISWS) found that most sandstone wells in the southwestern suburbs, including Joliet, are at risk of not meeting future demand even when accounting for Joliet’s switch to Lake Michigan water. While Joliet’s switch will significantly reduce overall aquifer demand, increases in demand from other communities will counteract this decline. Accordingly, the ISWS projects that most communities in the region will be forced off the aquifer with the only uncertainty being how soon this occurs. Water conservation and changes to suburban development patterns could lessen the strain, but future demand is unpredictable, and unaccounted-for demands from new users can accelerate projected groundwater losses by decades.

Over the last twenty years, the exponential growth of the warehouse and logistics sector has dramatically changed the industrial landscape in Joliet. This is due to a hot logistics market and the steady rise of e-commerce. Global retailers, logistics providers  and product distributors such as Amazon, Walmart, IKEA, Home Depot, Mars and Whirlpool are just a few of the major tenants in warehouses and distribution centers across Joliet’s twenty-one industrial parks which constitute nearly one-third of the city. [Journalist Alexander Sammon has described the sprawl of these boxed facilities as an enormous, horizontal equivalent game of Tetris](https://newrepublic.com/article/152836/elwood-illinois-pop-2200-become-vital-hub-americas-consumer-economy-its-hell). Since 2010, the workforce in transportation, warehousing, and utilities has grown 3%. The transportation, warehousing and utilities sector is ranked as the third-largest employer and employed 11.2% of Joliet population in 2021.
