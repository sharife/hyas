  cost of Joliet’s drinking water crisis while warehouses like Amazon have
  simultaneously received immense tax breaks and discounts on water to operate

      Talking to you all at the Freshwater Lab, I want to share that Joliet is in the middle of a water crisis, and a lot of the south suburbs are close to follow. Joliet is projected to be unable to meet their demand with their current water source by 2030, so that's a timetable of less than ten years before people don't have access to that water. Currently, the water source is an aquifer, so it's more related to the lake than the river. But water systems are all deeply entwined. And it's really fascinating because people need a new water source. They're trying to build this billion dollar pipeline to Chicago to start getting water from Lake Michigan, which is great. And actually, a lot of our folks are excited to have potentially cleaner water than what they've had before. But the city is saying that to pay for this billion dollar pipeline, they are going to triple people's water bills. And we do a lot of engagement on the doors around this. And folks have told me straight up many times that they would have to leave their home, potentially a home that they grew up in or move their family to, or whatever many reasons folks might have for setting up a home in Joliet, but they wouldn't be able to afford their lifestyle anymore if their water bill tripled. Right. And for a working class person, and especially if we go back to my stats about how much warehouse workers in particular are making, that triple increase is really dire. 


      And so the other interesting part of all this is that Amazon alone has gotten about $741 million in tax breaks from Northeast Illinois alone. So just the Chicago land area that we're in. And that's almost enough to pay for the entire pipeline. And this is money that's coming from taxpayer dollars that has been given to Amazon to set up shop, to provide unsafe and unstable jobs for people. And so to say all that, some of the work we've been doing is getting community members together, really getting input on what we think might be a fair solution for the community, and landing on asking some of these huge multi billion dollar corporations that are profiting excessively from this region in particular, to pay a little bit more so that everyone else can pay a little less. And out of our curiosity, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request, which was subsequently covered in a [Belt article](https://beltmag.com/joliet-illinois-largest-inland-port-running-out-of-water/) by a great reporter, Adam Mahoney. And we were curious to know how much Amazon is using and other warehouses are using. And we found that Amazon by itself, so just one of hundreds of warehouses in Will County, is using over 106 times the water as a regular household, and yet are paying pretty much the same rate. Right. And not to mention all the tax breaks they're getting. So within those tax breaks or water bills, are more than covered, right?
