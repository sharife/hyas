      Just transition is not a cookie cutter solution and it's not a cookie cutter template. And each community literally has to figure out, what is the type of job force that we want to see in our community? And we know from Little Village, like, it's agriculture. Like, there's so much agricultural knowledge that we should not be ashamed for it. I think that's one of the things about being an immigrant community as well, is that sometimes we feel like working the land can be embarrassing, but sometimes it's like such a gift, right, that we're able to grow fruit from a seed and go through that whole process and thinking about how that can be a possibility, how we can lower our carbon emission, right? If we produce locally, we can deliver literally a few feet away. We don't even need trucks. We'll probably just take it in our bikes, right, and start thinking about, like, those. I know it sounds like a little bit silly and it's a little bit utopian, but I think it could happen. We are just so close. it's not simple. I know it's not simple, but just like, the thought of being able to work with the land or being able to install solar farms in your community and working in your community and shopping in your community, that just, builds the wealth for folks to be able to thrive, right. And to look at their job is just like, not only a job, but something that they also enjoy doing. And I know it sounds weird. 




      Additional comments by Citlalli Trujillo of the Freshwater Lab:


      All the jobs that are offered in those kinds of communities are like warehouse, factory jobs. What do you see us as? What do you see as, you know, only someone you're making money off of us. And even then, those types of jobs, they're harmful. The dangerous labor that goes into a warehouse job, factory job, all the bending and the repetitiveness, that kind of thing hurts your body. It wears your body down over time. And even then again, those kinds of jobs don't care. They don't want you to unionize. They don't want you to bring up those kinds of concerns. They'll fire you. And you can be easily replaced by the next person. Exactly.

    intro: "### Edith Tovar, Senior Justice Transition Organizer with [Little

      (LVEJO)](http://www.lvejo.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about two example
      projects implemented by LVEJO - La Villita Park and las semillas de
      justicia, seeds for justice garden - that serve as models for moving
      towards a Just Transition."

      And so some of the examples that we have of just transition and Little Village is the Celotex site, which was once upon a time a Superfund site that has been converted into the second largest park, green space in Little Village, which is [La Villita Park](http://www.lvejo.org/our-accomplishments/reclaiming-green-space/), developed. The organizers back then, they had a lot of community meetings. They had a lot of input from residents. Through the data that they collected, they found out that there's close to about 2,000 children within a 1 mile radius that live in close proximity to this park. So they built a beautiful children's play area. There's a skate park that was designed by youth in the area and there's a few soccer fields and basketball courts and baseball fields. But yeah, those are examples of Just Transition, right, what was once something so toxic can be converted and can be utilized. 


      Again, another example is the [Semillas de Justicia (seeds of justice) garden](http://www.lvejo.org/our-accomplishments/community-garden/), which was another brownfield here. The problem was that there were dozens of old oil containers buried on the ground that started to seep. And with the seepage, a lot of toxic smells started to come up. And so the city was able to clean it and NeighborSpace was able to acquire that. And so we've been working with NeighborSpace to have a free community garden where we have about 45 families that have access to land, where they grow herbs, fruit, vegetables. And in these last two years that we have really opened up the garden, the first year in 2020, the gardeners produced about two tons of food. And that's like chilies, tomatoes, onions, garlic, things that we can really weigh, not so much the herbs. And in 2021, we saw an increase to four tons of food. So the same amount of land, just a whole lot of folks more interested in getting access to land. And the head gardener also created a program. And again, this is another mode of just transition, mutual aid, where a lot of the family saw that they were going to have a lot of their veggies leftover -they started hanging grocery bags from the fans. And we made social media posts like, if folks want to pick up fresh organic veggies, come pick them up at the garden, in a way, also distributing food in that way. And so those are examples of just transition. And so those are the examples that we would love to see projects like this duplicated and so many different opportunities.

The South Branch and the Sanitary and Ship Canal offer few places to access the river. It takes an adventurous spirit to move through industrial hubs, dodge semi trucks, and navigate broken glass to reach the water. The [Canalport Riverwalk](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-canalport-riverwalk-park-20220929-xnkf6dcj7zbblbuaigor7qmnsq-story.html), a five-acre park that straddles the South Branch and the canal, is one of the few access points on Chicago’s West Side. Its existence is barely known even to longtime residents.The courageous spirits who visit contend with smells of exhaust and grinding noise from [metal being shredded](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/1/13/22882507/pilsen-sims-metal-management-shredder-illinois-environmental-protection-agency) across the water.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies neighborhoods along this part of the river as environmental justice communities that face ongoing [environmental and public health harms](http://www.lvejo.org/years-after-coal-plant-fight-chicago-neighborhoods-take-on-diesel-exhaust/).

Here, pollution doesn’t cease but only takes new forms. For example, grassroots activism in Pilsen and Little Village shut down the [last two coal power plants](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2012-08-30-chi-closure-of-chicagos-crawford-fisk-electric-plants-ends-coal-era-20120830-story.html) along the Chicago River and made plans for clean energy hubs and green industry in their place. But, behind closed doors, corporations like [Amazon](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/11/19/despite-community-opposition-city-commission-approves-amazon-distribution-facility-in-pilsen/) and [HILCO](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-hilco-little-village-demolition-settlement-health-clinic-20201120-ixkekneboncg3mycgmnq5uc54u-story.html) launched plans for warehouses and distribution centers where power plants once stood. On Easter weekend 2020, [Hilco contractors blew up](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/04/11/old-crawford-coal-plant-smokestack-blown-up-sending-dust-into-little-village-during-global-pandemic/) the Crawford coal power plant in Little Village, blanketing the neighborhood in toxic dust during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hilco next [built a distribution center for Target](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/11/03/little-village-activists-install-billboard-slamming-hilco-6-months-after-dust-disaster/) a mile away from schools and a park that increased truck traffic by [400 vehicle movements per day](https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/12/27/hilco-plans-fleet-storage-yard-next-to-target-warehouse-in-little-village/) (a total of 700 trucks pass through the site every day).

Warehouses often receive [public funding through tax abatements and other incentives under](https://abc7chicago.com/amazon-warehouses-tax-breaks-communities-of-color/7955877/) the guise of creating new jobs. However, these jobs tend to be low-wage and have hazardous work environments, and there is [little guarantee that warehouse neighbors will find employment in them](https://southsideweekly.com/activists-demand-half-of-target-warehouse-jobs-go-to-little-village-residents/). Due to the [high number of injuries](https://www.ww4j.org/uploads/7/0/0/6/70064813/packaging_pain_report.pdf) in warehouse work, the jobs in question tend to be short-term.

Exclusion of community input characterizes development along the South Branch. The famous Damen Silos once stood on 23 acres next to Canalport Riverwalk Park. Abandoned long ago and featured in the movie Transformers: Age of Extinction, the State of Illinois looked to unload the cost of maintaining [the silos by selling the property](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/12/27/23528364/damen-silos-sold-community-objections-preservationists-environmentalists). Their sale transpired without involvement by residents or input from community leaders. Although they sit directly on the riverfront, environmentalists and river lovers had no say about the sale of the silos. Local groups and neighbors are concerned that more pollution is coming from [the new owner, who is notorious](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/12/27/23528364/damen-silos-sold-community-objections-preservationists-environmentalists) for building [an asphalt plant](https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/03/24/neighbors-slam-mckinley-park-asphalt-plants-bid-for-500-million-city-contract/) in McKinley Park in close proximity to a major park, school and homes [without proper notice.](https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/04/16/new-asphalt-plant-in-mckinley-park-surprised-local-leaders-now-theres-a-state-bill-to-warn-them/)

In contrast to this cycle of pollution and disenfranchisement, a [just transition approach](https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/) forefronts community-based economic initiatives. A [Just Transition](https://jtalliance.org/) framework places people first to avoid perpetuating environmental and labor injustices. This means active engagement in shifts around production and industry from all impacted groups including employers, workers, elected officials and neighbors to ensure the creation of well-paying green jobs with health benefits that reflect the vision and skills of the community.

Toward achieving a just transition, [the Pilsen-Little Village River Corridor Project](http://www.lvejo.org/sample-title-of-image-text-post-4-here/) developed “a master plan for a healthier, more accessible Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal corridor from Bubbly Creek to west of Pulaski Road on Chicago’s southwest side.” Community-based redevelopment of the area seeks to provide clean and healthy jobs, economic growth and options for leisure and recreation.

[The Freshwater Lab](https://www.freshwaterlab.org/) strives to contribute to a just transition by reimagining a green space in the Pilsen industrial corridor. Currently, we are collaborating on the Rio de Bienvenida/River of Welcome Project funded by the [E(art)h Chicago initiative](https://earthartchicago.org/rio-de-bienvenida/). The public art project will be situated at Canalport Riverwalk. It will be composed of laser-cut metal and mosaics facing the water with designs that symbolize the vision for cleaner air and water. Through a series of art workshops, community members engage in conversations and design discussions around how to make the park more welcoming and accessible.
