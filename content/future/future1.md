Introduction
Chicago’s wastewater is pumped at great cost into the Gulf of Mexico.   We propose recycling the water and piping it for industrial uses to water insecure communities.  This will increase the total amount of available water while protecting Lake Michigan from combined sewer overflow.


Body
No one in the Great Lakes region needs to drink recycled water.  Some effluent can be treated to drinking water standards for emergency supply and applications that require it, but water recycling represents a means of protecting the lakes and prioritizing their waters for drinking and domestic uses.  Boasting an elected board of commissioners and sizable water infrastructure, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago can lead the way in pioneering more lucrative and sustainable routes for water.  After water is sourced from Lake Michigan, treated, and dedicated to its primary uses, it would still flow through the combined sewers and MWRD treatment plants.  Part of MWRD’s considerable capacity involves seven separate wastewater treatment plants, one of which already employs state of the art ultraviolet disinfection.  These individual plants can each produce distinct forms of recycled water fit for specific uses such as heavy industry, light industry, or irrigation.  Every site of existing water treatment can be extended in due course to full water reclamation and resource recovery that transforms waste into revenue-generating products whose building blocks, in turn, can be reclaimed in an ongoing feedback loop.
