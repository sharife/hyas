title: Wealth from Waste
intro: "### What if we rejected the very possibility of water as waste? How
  might this shift get us out of the 19th century and help us to embrace the
  21st? What if, instead of flushing, we kept replenishing the tank? "

    intro: "### Yana Kalmyka, formerly with [Warehouse Workers for Justice
      (WWJ)](https://www.ww4j.org/), speaking in spring 2022 about the
      incredible cost of Joliet’s drinking water crisis while warehouses like
      Amazon have simultaneously received immense tax breaks and discounts on
      water to operate in the area."

      Talking to you all at the Freshwater Lab, I want to share that Joliet is in the middle of a water crisis, and a lot of the south suburbs are close to follow. Joliet is projected to be unable to meet their demand with their current water source by 2030, so that's a timetable of less than ten years before people don't have access to that water. Currently, the water source is an aquifer, so it's more related to the lake than the river. But water systems are all deeply entwined. And it's really fascinating because people need a new water source. They're trying to build this billion dollar pipeline to Chicago to start getting water from Lake Michigan, which is great. And actually, a lot of our folks are excited to have potentially cleaner water than what they've had before. But the city is saying that to pay for this billion dollar pipeline, they are going to triple people's water bills. And we do a lot of engagement on the doors around this. And folks have told me straight up many times that they would have to leave their home, potentially a home that they grew up in or move their family to, or whatever many reasons folks might have for setting up a home in Joliet, but they wouldn't be able to afford their lifestyle anymore if their water bill tripled. Right. And for a working class person, and especially if we go back to my stats about how much warehouse workers in particular are making, that triple increase is really dire. 


      And so the other interesting part of all this is that Amazon alone has gotten about $741 million in tax breaks from Northeast Illinois alone. So just the Chicago land area that we're in. And that's almost enough to pay for the entire pipeline. And this is money that's coming from taxpayer dollars that has been given to Amazon to set up shop, to provide unsafe and unstable jobs for people. And so to say all that, some of the work we've been doing is getting community members together, really getting input on what we think might be a fair solution for the community, and landing on asking some of these huge multi billion dollar corporations that are profiting excessively from this region in particular, to pay a little bit more so that everyone else can pay a little less. And out of our curiosity, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request, which was subsequently covered in a [Belt article](https://beltmag.com/joliet-illinois-largest-inland-port-running-out-of-water/) by a great reporter, Adam Mahoney. And we were curious to know how much Amazon is using and other warehouses are using. And we found that Amazon by itself, so just one of hundreds of warehouses in Will County, is using over 106 times the water as a regular household, and yet are paying pretty much the same rate. Right. And not to mention all the tax breaks they're getting. So within those tax breaks or water bills, are more than covered, right?

Modern society is acclimated to the drain, a liquid parallel to the garbage can. The cyclicality of water suggests another model – drops that morph from rain to lakewater to fog and ice as they move through a number of natural and engineered systems. When we easily dispense with water, we break its cycle and create waste that comes back to haunt us. In an age when we long for water during droughts and fear it during intense storms, a non-wasteful orientation must emerge. There is no choice but to balance new water extremes through reservoirs and reuse.  We need to close the loop to emulate nature and the ways water circulates through many landscapes and forms.
Closing the loop of the Sanitary and Ship Canal marks a crucial step in transforming the Rust Belt to the Water Belt. Instead of diverting water from Chicago as a southbound wastestream, we can recycle it to support industry in water-stressed communities. This would help protect Lake Michigan for human needs and ecosystem viability.

Water recycling sheds its utopian glaze with every update about the West’s once-in-a-1200-year drought, the demise of the Colorado River, or the imminent collapse of the Ogallala Aquifer. Even in proximity to deep lakes and wide rivers, groundwater levels across the world are bottoming out. Irreplaceable water sources are disappearing and humans cannot continue to treat viable water as waste.  

The Great Lakes watershed does not face acute water stress, but it has responsibility and incentive to grow its available supply while ensuring the lakes don’t go the way of other water bodies. The time has come for Chicago to undertake its next wondrous feat of water engineering. Reengineering the world’s most engineered waterway in the era of climate change looks like this.

Here’s what stays the same: Rain and drains still meet in Chicago’s combined sewer system, slosh through the deep tunnel, and undergo treatment at wastewater plants.

The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) runs seven treatment plants. We propose that each of these plants is enhanced to produce water for specific purposes like industry, agriculture, or even emergency supply. Most will provide water for industrial processes in communities whose water source has collapsed and, as a result, request drinking water from Lake Michigan. Lake Michigan is not limitless. In fact, the volume of water that the State of Illinois can withdraw from the lake is set by the U.S. Supreme Court. In order to both sustain our communities and enable economic growth, we must reorient ourselves and turn wastewater into the basis for sustainable industry.

Unlike wealth that generates waste, wealth that comes from waste must be distributed equally with direct benefits for those who disproportionately experience the failure of existing infrastructure. For example, the introduction of recycled water can both increase overall supply and raise revenue to help make water bills more affordable and to retrofit dangerous lead service lines.

In conjunction with water recycling, biogas can be derived from wastewater and help with the transition to renewable energy. Other valuable minerals and metals can also be harvested as part of water recycling. In fact, the MWRD is already doing some of this. It has teamed up with Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technology for the world’s biggest harvest of nutrients from wastewater. In a massive closed loop, Ostara harvests phosphorus and nitrogen at MWRD’s Stickney Plant and turns it into Crystal Green fertilizer. As a continuous release fertilizer, Crystal Green supercharges the growth of plants without overloading them with nutrients or relying on a petrochemical base. Whereas conventional fertilizers sit at the top of fields and easily runoff during rain storms, Crystal Green goes right to the roots of plants. This helps prevent harmful algae blooms which cause dead zones. Crystal Green shows how wastewater can yield socially beneficial products that bring revenue back into Greater Chicago’s water reclamation district.

Every site of existing water treatment can be extended to full water reclamation and resource recovery that transforms waste into revenue-generating products whose building blocks, in turn, can be reclaimed in an ongoing feedback loop.
