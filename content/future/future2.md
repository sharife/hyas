Introduction
In a world increasingly saturated in petrochemicals, there is no longer an away where we can send our waste.  Currently, we treat precious rain like garbage, hurting humans and their ecosystems all along the way.  In the City of Big Shoulders and gargantuan water infrastructure, we cannot stay focused on narrow, antiquated plans.  We need to pioneer new systems that allow us to survive and thrive.  Chicago should be the capital of the Water Belt.

What if we rejected the very possibility of water as waste? How might this shift in categorization
get us out of the 19th century and help us to embrace the 21st? What if, instead of flushing, we kept replenishing the tank?  Closing the loop of the Sanitary and Ship Canal marks a crucial step in transforming the Rust Belt to the Water Belt.  The idea sheds its utopian glaze with every update about the West’s once in 1200 year drought, the demise of the Colorado River, or the imminent collapse of the Ogallala Aquifer.  Even in proximity to deep lakes and wide rivers,
groundwater levels across the world are bottoming out.  Irreplaceable water sources are disappearing and humans require new orientations toward water.  Although the Great Lakes basin does not face acute water stress, it is enveloped by it and has both responsibility and incentive to grow its available supply while ensuring the lakes don’t go the way of other water bodies.  The time has come for Chicago to undertake its next wondrous feat of water engineering.

One Water
After humans transform it, does water remain water? Do contamination and treatment yield something else entirely?  Have humans forged new combinations that disqualify the essential liquid from being cleansing, life-giving water? The term “produced water” is often applied to the output of desalination and recycling, but wouldn’t all water drawn, disinfected, and distributed fit the definition? Isn’t all water in the 21st century, in essence, produced?  If the answer is no, then the categories of source, storm, and waste water need clearer delineation and protections that keep the elements from one out of the others.  If water remains water no matter the energy and inputs humans apply (or can become water by having its most dangerous elements neutralized), then the categories melt into more holistic understandings.  Due to dwindling supplies of water on earth, this more capacious definition likely cannot be avoided.  We simply must look upon all available forms as water.  The U.S. Water Alliance promotes this perspective as One Water, accepting and maximizing water’s turn through human systems as a unified whole.
The One Water idea holds that just as water’s variant forms and movement through ecosystems are integrated, such is the case as it cycles through human systems and absorbs their traces.  Whether we label it drinking, storm, or waste water, or it takes form as steam, ice, or beer, these phases are part of one and the same thing.  Water’s relative quality and viability at any particular stage influences subsequent ones.  That water is H2O is not a given, rather one possible outcome among many.  Every substance that humans mix with water on individual or collective scales – from detergents to pharmaceuticals to fuels – become components of it.  
When it comes to questions of quality –whether water can be utilized or consumed—, human decisions are imperative.  Water quality standards, the nature of testing, what can be released, and how new toxins become measured and neutralized all determine the nature of the water we encounter.  What ends up in the water and what we test for, in turn, determines processes of water treatment.  The more contaminated the water, the more treatment is necessary and the more negative impacts other social systems (like health care and education) need to absorb. Therefore, it makes sense to address what is released into water and how it is treated in a similarly integrated manner.  No matter its levels of regulation or deregulation, treatment or neglect, we cannot afford to treat water as garbage.
