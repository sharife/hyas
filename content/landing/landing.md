### The backward river in question is the Chicago, reversed at the dawn of the 20th century to serve industrial capitalism in a rising metropolis.

Before 1900, the winding Chicago River flowed into Lake Michigan. Since 1900, the river has diverted Lake Michigan water into a canal that branches into the Des Plaines, Illinois, and Mississippi Rivers. Its outlet is the Gulf of Mexico. Yes, you read that correctly. The Chicago River or, more precisely, the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) punctures the continental divide between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River.

Compelling on its own, our story also dramatizes a widespread scenario of crumbling American infrastructure. At its heart rests a basic denial of malfunction, public harm and the disproportionate burdens placed on communities of color. In telling the story of The Backward River, we aim to cut through this denial and speak plainly.
