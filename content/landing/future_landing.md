Map Heading
Discover what the future may hold for interconnected water and communities.
Introduction
We can address problems of flooding and drought by building systems that reflect 21st century knowledge as they facilitate economic growth and more widespread financial stability.  We can revitalize our rivers as corridors of clean industry and innovation. The perfect place to begin the transformation is along America’s most engineered waterway: the backward Chicago River.
Body
With over 20% of the world’s freshwater, the Great Lakes watershed can survive and thrive in the era of accelerated climate change.  Like the oasis that it is, the watershed can support the arrival of people and development of new businesses and forms of production.  Such trend reversing change from the Rust Belt to the Water Belt portends a stable future, but it cannot occur without some important upgrades. Vitally, water must remain under public oversight rather than being diverted by corporations for private profit.  In tandem, basic water bills must become affordable for every household.  Pulling oil pipelines out of the Great Lakes and their tributary rivers marks another necessary safeguard.  The Freshwater Lab’s contribution to The Water Belt future are plans for recycling water that is currently treated like waste.  Rather than paying to dispose of water across the continent, we propose its reuse in industrial processes.
Water recycling plants can anchor industrial complexes that simultaneously capture biogas and harvest minerals for new products.  Along with the jobs in building these systems, water recycling complexes can anchor  permanent green jobs and contribute to a closed loop economy.
