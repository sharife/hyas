Map Heading
Listen to each branch of the Chicago River speak candidly about their experience.
Introduction
The pre-industrial span of the Chicago River included North and South Branches and a Main Stem. In the name of flushing the metropolis and allowing for the circulation of commodities, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal was forged in 1900. Its perceived success led to the North Shore Channel that drains upscale suburbs and later to the artery for heavy industry, the Cal-Sag Channel to the south. Part of reversing the river entailed designating a set of boundaries and labels. These include an Upper North Branch, North Branch and South Branch. Arbitrary boundaries like these often become weaponized to allocate benefits and burdens along race and class lines. Just as these arbitrary boundaries are used to determine where and for whom investment and disinvestment occurs, they also inform how data is presented and shared.
Body
Here we should have an explanation of “The River Speaks” project.  Maybe from Tristen’s artist statement?

The characters of the river came about because we wanted to highlight the personalities and archetypes that emerge from the Chicago River. There are many structural systems at place that dictate how the river is used. These archetypes represent the players involved with maintaining the status quo and those that actively fight for a more holistic, sustainable waterway. We developed the particular characters of each river branch based on its history, contemporary use and communities that live alongside it.
