Introduction
This winding waterway, flanked along most of its borders by woods and walking trails, calls back to the river’s past while offering views of its potential future.

Body

As a narrower and shallower branch which flows through the northwest suburbs and northwest side of Chicago before mingling with the North Branch, the Upper North Branch is the least manipulated section of the river. While other branches have been shaped by the city, the barge industry, and unabashed growth, the Upper North Branch’s smaller stature and distance from the canals enable it to preserve the bends  and memories of the river basin. It has had some work done though, including a new sewer tunnel built in Jefferson Park in 2014 that connects with the Deep Tunnel.
