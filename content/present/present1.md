Introduction
Environmental personhood establishes two things: it grants legal standing and public recognition. A river with legal rights may access the courts as a plaintiff. A river that is a being counts as  a full person, “indivisible and whole,” who may not be arbitrarily divided in the name of property or exploitation.  
Body
When recognized as a being, a river shares equal standing with humans and, as such, may rule over itself and be in relationship with others. In other words, according to Gwendolyn Gordon, extending legal standing to nonhuman entities means that we no longer think of nature as merely a resource to be exploited by profit making or to be managed for its beauty or sustainability in the name of conservation. Rather, personhood grants nature jurisdiction over itself and is no longer human-centered.  

The idea of river personhood raises many questions. What is the river? Is it defined by its banks or does it include plant life, sediments and other living beings that depend on it? What happens when it overflows? What’s in its best interest? How and when is it harmed? How is a person understood and defined? And, ultimately, is the human the best point of reference? When considering these questions, we can draw on parallels such as the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling that corporations are persons with rights of free speech.  If a corporation can enjoy the right to pollute bodies of water, then should the water bodies similarly be able to have their say?
