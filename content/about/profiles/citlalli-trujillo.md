intention: My intention with the Backward River is to highlight people's
  experiences and relationship with the Chicago River in different parts of the
  city through stories. Depending on where you live along the river, oneâ€™s
  experiences it very differently. Along the North Branch and Main Stem, you see
  lots of recreational activities such as kayaking and bike paths, but on the
  South Branch the concentration of heavy industry prevents the use of
  riverfront areas. I hope my work will help support the need for a Just
  Transition in communities that want to shift away from dirty industries and
  reclaim their spaces along the river. I hope my contribution to the research
  about the Chicago River and Sanitary Ship Canal will aid to improve the way we
  treat our natural resources and our vulnerable communities.
