  **Intentions:** My intention in working with The Backward River is to collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals who care about environmental justice. My main goal working with the team is to help develop and maintain this website to bring awareness of available research, tools, and events to foster connections between The Backward River and partners, organizations, and policy influencers. It’s exciting to be part of a team that reaches out to local communities and organizations to make real change. One of the reasons I began working in web development was because it used both my artistic and my marketing skills. It is highly satisfying to use these skills with a team passionate about making environmental and social changes.
