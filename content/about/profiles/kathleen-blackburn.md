  **Intention:** I want to reimagine the relationship we have to our watershed. By recognizing what currently shapes our rivers and impacts the communities who rely on them, my aim is to help heal our shared waters. I hope to connect with each other
  around questions of:


  * How we can thrive in an ever-changing water geography?

  * What can we do to repurpose our canal and introduced species to create equitable ownership of these rivers?

  * In what ways can we promote the perspectives of BIPOC communities whose activism continues to conserve and protect our most precious resources?
