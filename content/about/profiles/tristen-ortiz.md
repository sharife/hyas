  **Intention:** My intentions with the backward river is to create art that can be
  not only accessible but reflective of the issues that surround the Chicago
  river and the city as whole. The choice to focus on slow violence as a subject
  came from its peculiar name and its relation to how private and public
  entities use policy to justify blatant environmental racism. Due to the
  massive covid-19 pandemic it has amplified and exposed these issues and it can
  not be ignored anymore.
