intention: My intention in collaborating on the Backward River media project is
  to draw connections to the compounding policies that put profits over people
  and serve to maintain and amplify systems of oppression baked into our
  capitalist society, using the engineered Chicago waterway as the throughline
  for exposing this disparity by design. I grew up hearing stories of the
  Chicago River reversal as an engineering marvel that was key to our city’s
  growth and success. Meanwhile I experienced tranquility and easy access to the
  Upper North Branch of the river, biking and hanging out along it as a kid,
  with no concept of the very different function of the rest of the river. It
  wasn’t until much later that the curtain was pulled back on my white, middle
  class upbringing to see that my river and life experience came at the expense
  of Black and brown communities across the city, communities who are mostly
  walled off from the waterway by dangerous industrial and warehouse operations
  that use the waters as a highway for products and pollution. All this has come
  into starker focus and felt ever more urgent as we worked on this project
  during the Covid-19 pandemic and uprisings against state brutality and racial
  inequity. How dystopian it felt for the city of Chicago to literally use the
  Chicago River as a moat, separating the wealthy downtown from working class
  people, and the bridges as literal leverage to only allow elites into the loop
  and to kettle in protestors who dared to take to those streets.
