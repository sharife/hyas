  **Intentions:** My intention is to address local, regional, and continental water
  problems produced and perpetuated by the Backward River. At the local level,
  South Side communities suffer from the environmental racism of toxic
  industries along the river while downtown and North Side communities enjoy
  recreation, restoration, and beautification on the same waterway. As some
  areas of the river receive regeneration efforts, green gentrification must be
  mitigated. Regionally, some Chicago suburbs live alongside heavy industry and
  warehousing, and have dwindling water supplies. Meanwhile, the Chicago River
  connected to the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal sends our wastewater through
  those communities. Ultimately, the Backward River sends that wastewater across
  the continent, damaging waterways along the way and producing a dead zone in
  the Gulf of Mexico.
