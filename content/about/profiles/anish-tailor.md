intention: "This project is an opportunity to reorient ourselves towards nature.
  My intentions in participating are several: to show citizens of Chicago how to
  reconnect with nature so that people may connect to themselves; to develop an
  emotional connection with the water so that we are compelled to appreciate and
  protect it; to empower people to feel that the water is for them, and not for
  corporations; to become aware of the structural systems in place that exploit
  nature for profit; to view water and nature as a gift, and not as something to
  extract value out of; to cultivate a kinship with the water that is rooted in
  care, compassion, and love."
bio:  Anish is an urban planner, audio narrative storyteller, and community
  organizer, originally from Dallas, Texas. He moved to Chicago to start grad
  school at UIC in January 2019 after living in Washington DC for eight years.
  He’s interested in reconceptualizing and reimagining urban space in a way that
  allows for citizens to feel more connected to each other and to the earth. As
  a native Texan, Anish did not grow up near water, so living so close to Lake
  Michigan and having access to the beach is a fun and new novelty for him.
  Anish was a community organizer and activist for the south asian LGBTQ
  community, and for people of color more broadly, in the DC metro area. He
  worked as an international trade economist before switching careers to urban
  planning. Currently, Anish is based in Seattle working on bicycle and
  pedestrian infrastructure projects. Anish runs the Freshwater Lab instagram
  account.
