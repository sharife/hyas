  **Intention:** By focusing on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, I want to return
  to the city’s original sin of sending its waste south to afflict downstate
  Illinois, southern states and the Gulf of Mexico. The reason for taking up the
  early 20th Century sin now is that the environmental and public health abuses
  have mounted. The Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico fed, in part, by
  Chicagoland’s wastewater has grown to the size of New Jersey and shows no
  signs of abating. Flooding in Chicago and throughout Illinois has become an
  expected disaster even as other parts of the Midwest and West face crippling
  droughts. A water system created to allow industries to pollute with impunity
  and metropolises to foist their wastes on vulnerable communities is out of
  date and dangerous in the 21st Century. Confronting the shortcomings of the
  past is a key step to re-envisioning a better future in Chicago, Illinois and
  the Great Lakes watershed. I look to culture and storytelling as ways to
  engage the broader public in acts of reimagining our infrastructure and
  environment.

  **Bio:** Rachel Havrelock is the founder and director of the Freshwater Lab and a
  professor of English at the University of Illinois at Chicago. A childhood of
  swimming in the Great Lakes created an indissoluble bond with water. Decades
  of research in the Middle East led to her books*River Jordan*and*The Joshua
  Generation*, as well as to a position on the Ecopeace Middle East
  International Advisory Committee. Since 2015, Dr. Havrelock has focused on
  Great Lakes research and teaching a new generation of water leaders. She
  believes that the Great Lakes watershed can survive and thrive amidst
  accelerated Climate Change, but that a series of necessary actions must occur
  now. Through collaboration, the Freshwater Lab has created both The Backward
  River and the[Freshwater Stories](http://freshwaterstories.com/)digital
  platforms.
