title: About
intro: The Backward River team is composed of members of the Freshwater Lab at
  the University of Illinois Chicago. As artists, city planners, writers,
  scientists and scholars in Chicago, we bring a multi-faceted approach to
  reimagining a thriving watershed with equitable access to a healthy river
  system. Our team formed in May 2020, amid record flooding in Chicago and the
  first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the urgent need for
  addressing the environmental and public health impacts of our current water
  infrastructure, we created and designed The Backward River. During a time of
  global pandemic, economic meltdown, mounting violence toward Black and
  Indigenous people of color and the rise of a civil rights movement, we studied
  how the Chicago Area Waterway System produced the city and conditions in which
  we live and began to envision their transformation.
